# Introduction

## Welcome to Kropply!

Kropply is an AI autocorrect for runtime errors.
Focus on shipping code faster while the AI coding partner provides suggestions for unit-level bugs.

<!-- todo prettify -->

No prompting.
We believe that you code (and the comments/documentation) you have should be enough to figure out what you want to achieve.

Test Driven Development.
We know that writing tests is boring and feels unproductive **BUT** with Kropply we use the expected output from that test to understand how to fix the code. Less prompting from you.

### How it works

Kropply runs in the background whenever you save a TypeScript file (.ts, .tsx).
It uses the expected output from test to generate code to correct the issue.

### What you'll need

-   Visual Studio Code
-   TypeScript project
-   Jest testing framework
