# Introduction

## Welcome to Kropply!

Kropply is an AI autocorrect for runtime errors.
Focus on shipping code faster while the AI coding partner provides suggestions for unit-level bugs.

<!-- todo prettify -->

**🚫 No prompting**\
We believe that you code (and the comments/documentation) you have should be enough to figure out what you want to achieve.

**🧪 Test Driven Development**\
We know that writing tests is boring and feels unproductive **BUT** with Kropply we use the expected output from that test to understand how to fix the code. Less prompting from you.

### How it works

Kropply runs in the background whenever you save a TypeScript file (.ts, .tsx).
It uses the expected output from tests to generate code to correct the issue.

### What you'll need

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   [TypeScript project](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io/)
