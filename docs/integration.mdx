# Integration

<!-- This will be turned into a complete guide -->
<!-- Git clone broken repo -->

Let's get started by cloning a repository that has built in errors.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panoshalios/kropply-demo.git
```

<!-- Open a file in VS Code and install packages -->

Open that repository with VS Code and then install the packages.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Kropply

<!-- CMD + S -->

Open `mergesort.test.ts`. All you need to do now is to save it.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac" default>
        `CMD + S`
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows-linux" label="Linux/Window">
        `CTRL + S`
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<!-- Wait and click on the Kropply panel -->

Wait a bit for suggestions to generate. In the background, Kropply is running Jest to capture the errors.\
On the **left hand side panel** you should see the number of suggestions on top of the Kropply logo.
