    Make sure you follow this checklist.
        1. **Make sure you are connected to Kropply**. Set the access token once again. On the bottom right you should see that you are connected to Kropply.
        2. **TypeScript, Jest, Test Script**. You need a TypeScript project and Jest installed as **developer dependencies**. Finally you need an npm test script which could be as simple as "test": "jest".
        3. **Check the terminal**. Press CMD+J or CTRL+J to bring up the terminal. Make sure that Jest is running properly within the Kropply terminal. *If this step is failing, please reach out since we want to know why it is not running on your environment.*
